# devops

Hello,

This was my first attempt to build and deploy application to Microsoft Azure. Since I've had a small amount of time I didn't make any changes in the actual flask app
(not sure if it was necessary). I've just deployed it and made a github repository. Sorry that I'm sending this on the last day of intership challenge and thank you
for giving me an opportunity to become an intern.

Regards
